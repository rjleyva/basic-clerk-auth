# Basic Clerk Auth + Tailwind + daisyUI in React 🔐

This project is my personal approach to learning how to implement authentication using Clerk, form handling with React Hook Form and Zod, and styling React applications with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI.

## 🚧 TODO

- [ ] Set up React Hook Form for managing form state
- [ ] Use Zod for schema-based form validation
- [ ] Add theme toggle (dark/light mode) using Tailwind CSS and daisyUI utilities
